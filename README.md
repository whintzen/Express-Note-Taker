# :office_worker: Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker  :woman_office_worker:

## Concept
Note Taker is an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file

## Business Context
For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## User Story
```
  AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

  I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

  SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```md
*  Application should allow users to create
   and save notes.

*  Application should allow users to view
   previously saved notes.

*  Application should allow users to delete
   previously saved notes.
```

## Instructions
  * Open a terminal and run these commands to set up the environment files `npm install`, `npm install fs`, `npm install path `, `npm install uuid` and `npm install express` to create the node_modules folder and to add additional information.  
  * Run `node server.js`, this connects you to the PORT 3000.
  * Open a browser and and type `localhost:3000` and this will open the Note Taker Application in the browser.

  ## How the App Works
  * Once the App opens, it will display a list of employees and above this list is a Search box.   You can start typing the first name of the employee you would like to see information on, and as you type employees with similiar letters in their name will first appear, until the employees first name is spelt out.  Please note that you can get more than one employee with the same first name.  You may not have to spell out the full name in order to find the employee.
  * You can also sort the file by clicking on the first Name label.  This will sort the file in ascending or decencending order.  Please note that each time you refresh the page you will get a different list of employees.
